"""
Write a program that takes a list of numbers, creates another list of even numbers from the first list, and prints it.

E.g. if my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then your program should print the list [2, 4].
"""
# the following line reads the list from the input; do not modify it, please
my_numbers = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]

# work with the variable 'my_numbers'
print([x for x in my_numbers if x % 2 == 0])
