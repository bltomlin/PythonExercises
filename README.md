# What is this?
This is my personal repository for doing structured Python exercises on the internet to improve my problem solving, CS fundamentals and debugging skills. It is used mostly used to track how many problems I solve per day and keep me motivated as I pursue a better understanding of programming concepts.
# How is it organized?
I have organized this repository based on projects. Each folder at the root contains practice problems that I solved in order to better understand core concepts for the project that I am currently working on.
