Imagine there are three children in a family and they all wrote down what they want to be when they grow up:

children = {'Emily': 'artist', 'Adam': 'astronaut', 'Nancy': 'programmer'}
Let's say you want to store not only the profession they have chosen but also their age: Emily is 5, Adam is 9, and Nancy is 14. To do so, you can create nested dictionaries for each key in the outer dictionary.

For each name, create a nested dictionary with the keys 'profession' and 'age', modify the dictionary children, but don't print it.
