#Suppose you need to store a path to a file in lowercase, using the built-in lower() function for this purpose. Look at the code below: when printing path, will we get the string c:\users\public\desktop\temporary\newsletters? If not, just fix the string we pass to path; you do not need to print it.

path = "C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop\\Temporary\\Newsletters".lower()
